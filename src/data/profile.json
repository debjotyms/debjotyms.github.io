  "description": "In my second year of college, I became interested in Machine Learning. Since then, along with other development practices, I've been teaching myself AI and ML. Additionally, I practice regularly on LeetCode. I am interested in Computer Vision, LLMs, and Predictive Analysis, and I've successfully completed several projects in these areas. Furthermore, I have a solid understanding of cloud concepts and hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure. I am also 2x cloud certified, holding the DP-100: Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate certification. To complement this, I utilize version control systems like Git and GitHub to manage my projects efficiently. I also have a YouTube Channel and Personal Blog where I try to share everything I learn."
