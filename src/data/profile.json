  "description": "In my second year of university, I became interested in Machine Learning. Since then, along with other development practices, I've been teaching myself AI/ML. I am interested in Computer Vision, LLMs and RAG Based Systems, and Iâ€™ve completed several projects in these areas. Furthermore, I have a solid understanding of cloud concepts and hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure. I am also 2x cloud certified, holding the DP-100: Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate certification. I am also proficient in Git and GitHub, and I have successfully passed the GitHub Foundations Certification exam. I am an active open-source contributor, currently collaborating with an amazing team of open-source enthusiasts to localize the OpenTelemetry documentation. I also have a YouTube Channel and Personal Blog where I share everything I learn."
